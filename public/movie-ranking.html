 <h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
 <hr>
<h3>Nerve </h3>
<p>A brief history of the film reveals that it started out as a popular young adult novel by Jeanne Ryan. I haven’t read the book, but I have seen the “Simpsons” episode where Homer is willing to degrade himself for money. The rules of “Nerve” are very similar. This underground game has two modes, player and watcher. Players are given “dares” by watchers. Upon completion of the dares, which are recorded by the player and other watchers, cash is immediately deposited into the player’s account. The more dangerous the dare, the more money one can make. If a player fails, or bails out of the dare, their game is over and they forfeit all their dough. If a player freaks out, and gets law enforcement involved, the street adage “snitches gets stitches” is quite rudely demonstrated. </p>
<h3> Haseen dillruba</h3>
<p>Director Vinil Mathew and writer Kanika Dhillon take us into the starkly different worlds of Rani and Rishu that has the simplicity and relatability of a small town and at the same time, an eerie sense of the looming disaster waiting to happen. This in itself lends the film’s non-linear screenplay an undercurrent of tension and constant suspense. This makes it quite engaging, entertaining and unpredictable for the most part, as we see the lead characters go through their journey of love, lust and desires. There might be a point where you’d have cracked the plot, but that won’t be a big spoiler.</p>
<h3>Ugly</h3>
<p>Ugly does not have over-loaded music, loud background or any of those cliches most Bollywood films survive on. And, without the help of any of these formuale, it still manages to put across its message. Ugly traces a week into the lives of people around a ten-year-old girl Kali (Anshika Shrivastava) who is kidnapped. Unlike Kashyap's movies, Ugly does not have too much of political and social innuendos. This one is about human follies and emotions.</p>
